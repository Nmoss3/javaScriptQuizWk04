# JavaScript Quiz!

## Description

In this challenge we were to use HTML, CSS and Javascript together to create a timed quiz about JavaScript. This user friendly quiz will challenge you to race a timer to get a high score. Each user will also be able to keep track of their high score each time they return to the application and try to beat it for the next time. If the test taker has forgotten their high score, at the top left of the screen they will be able to view all of the scores logged with initials.

## User Experience

At the start screen there is a breif description of the quiz and the option to start the quiz. In the top left corner of the page there is also the option to see all of the high scores previously logged into the end of the quiz. 

If the user starts the quiz they will see a timer displayed in the top right of the quiz window that counts down until the end of the quiz. Once the timer reaches zero, the quiz is over. If the user chooses the incorrect answer, time left will be deducted from the user and the correct answer will be displayed and the next question will then appear.

At the end of the quiz, either time ran out or the user answered all of the questions, a new screen will appear allowing the user to enter their initials and see the score they have. If they want to run the quiz again they are more than welcome to.
